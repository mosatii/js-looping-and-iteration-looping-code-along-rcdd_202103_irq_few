// To get more acquainted with `while`, your task is to write a function,
// `countDown`, that takes in any positive integer and, starting from that number,
// counts down to zero using `console.log()`. So, when written if you were to run:
function countDown(m){
  let i = m;
  while (i>=0) {
    console.log(i)
    i--
  }
  }
  countDown(10)
